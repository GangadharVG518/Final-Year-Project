# Final-Year-Project

Smart Traffic Management System 🚦

📌 Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System is a Final Year Project aimed at enhancing urban traffic flow and reducing congestion using real-time data processing, intelligent algorithms, and automation. This system dynamically monitors traffic conditions and optimizes signal timings to improve transportation efficiency and reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

🎯 Key Objectives

Monitor real-time traffic using sensors, cameras, or simulation data.

Analyze traffic density and flow using AI/ML algorithms.

Dynamically control traffic signal timing based on live traffic data.

Prioritize emergency vehicles and reduce waiting time.

Provide a user dashboard for traffic insights and analytics.
